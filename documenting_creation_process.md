# Documenting the creation process of this project.

This is supposed to be an ELT process. I decided this way because I feel like this is a lot more used in todays industry. Bringing the data into the datawarehouse before performing any transformations allow us to have a lot more accurate data and to make the available information for the client easier to get.

# 1st Step - Data Source
The first step for this project would be to decide in a data source and the information that you need to bring in to fulfil the requirements of the project. In this case I don't yet have an specific goal to the end product of this project so it is hard to decide on what data sources we will be working on. Due to that I decided to work with some data that I think to be easily accessable and that would make interesting set up later on.

What I would like to develop is something cool that would be useful for society, but as of now I don't know much on how to get that going. So at first I'm just going to fetch some data and hope to do something with it later.
